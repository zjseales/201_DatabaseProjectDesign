## Lab Questions

### 1. Identify and list possible business rules for the Julienned School of Music case study.
### 2. Suggest whether the rules could be enforced automatically within the information system.

Minimum/Maximum age requirement (AUTO)
Minimum experience required. (MANUAL)
Students may only be enrolled for 1 instrument at any one time. (AUTO)
Students must pay fees before attending classes. (AUTO)
Students must pass audition before attending classes (MANUAL)
Classes must not clash (AUTO)
Maximum class size / student-body total (AUTO)

### 3. Sometimes, business rules should not be strictly enforced, but should instead raise a warning that users can override if appropriate. Describe some realistic examples of such cases (either within the Julienned case study or more generally).

Passing the audition is necessary to enrolment but fees payment may have exceptions as to when the payment must be completed.
Perhaps a student could choose to pay enrolment fees using down payments or have an extension on the payment due date.

Might have available spaces and allow exceptions to the min/max age requirements, also min experience.

I guess you could make exceptions to clashing classes by adding recorded lectures, though that starts to complicate timetables.

Might choose to add an extra person to class size if necessary.
