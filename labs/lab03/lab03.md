## Follow-up questions.


"Would you like teachers to have the ability to update grades and attendance logs of their own students?"

"Will all teachers have the ability to check the information regarding any student?" (Or will different staff members have different privileges?)

"Are there any other staff I should be aware of that may use this software?"

"Will Students get to choose their classes?" (are they dependent on the instrument they play)

"I know students will have the ability to change instrument once enrolled,
but before enrollment, will people be confined to audition with the instrument they chose?"
"For example, if someone chose to enroll as a pianist but before the audition decided they wanted to switch to another instrument.
Could they change their chosen instrument?"

"Are scholarships given based on a students grades?" (close-ended but invites further discussion)

"What defines a domestic student?"

"I don't want to pry but it may be important in regards to compatibility. What package are you using for staff payments?" 
(Explain that you will need to check compatibility with your own possible forms and reports you plan to create).

"Students can apply for a masters, will it only be 3rd year students who are given this option?"
